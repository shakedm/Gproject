managed to almost make it work. then the SQL server went haywire and don't know how to access it or reset it.
basicilly i just used Django framework to create the code as simple as i could in python and not have too many stuff from the SQL server side.
I feel bad leaving it like that after all the hours of work i put into it before it crashed so i just decided to send it like that.
Sorry for the long wait.
