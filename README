managed to almost make it work. then the SQL server went haywire and don't know how to access it or reset it.
basicilly i just used Django framework to create the code as simple as i could in python and not have too many stuff from the SQL server side.
I feel bad leaving it like that after all the hours of work i put into it before it crashed so i just decided to send it like that.
Sorry for the long wait.


ENV and stuff that code needs to run:
1) python django mysqlclient
2) a SQL server as in the settings.py file. you can change it there i went with MYSQL config (just what i found and it looked simple at first)
3) The grace of god

things you should be able to do but i didn't got to test it cause it kept crashing: 
-call the "matcher" function with a job to search for.
-run the main.py and type in the title and skills for the job you want.
